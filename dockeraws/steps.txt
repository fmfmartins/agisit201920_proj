this is basically all in lab08 guide, tbh

verifying clean enviroment with 
vagrant global-status

vagrant halt if any machines running

vagrant destroy all machines (at least irrelevant to this lab)

use Vagrantfile and bootstrap.sh from cloud experiment to launch cloud management node

ping osmgmt (192.168.56.10)

ssh in osmgmt

go to aws website to get credentials, and update them in credentials.sh and terraform.tfvars

generate ssh key (rsa, 2048)

convert private key to pem format (ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa) - turns out i didn't need to

launch terraform init, plan, apply

update myhosts file, update /etc/hosts file, with ip public addresses

ssh-keyscan manager worker1 worker2 >> .ssh/known_hosts

afterwards, run playbook (incomplete!!!)
